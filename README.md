The SuperMarket project is a Spring Boot application that allows users to browse and purchase items from a virtual grocery store. The application has the following features:

Item catalog: Users can view a list of all available items, including their names, descriptions, and prices.
1. Shopping cart: Users can add items to their cart and view the total cost of their purchase.
2. Checkout: Users can proceed to checkout and enter their shipping and payment information to complete their purchase.
3. Order history: Users can view their past orders and the details of each order.
4. Authentication and Authorization: Users must log in to access the application's features. Only authorized users can add items to their cart and proceed to checkout.
5. Admin Panel: Admins can add new items, edit existing items and delete items from the store

The application is built using the Spring Boot framework and makes use of the following technologies:
1. Spring MVC for handling HTTP requests and handling routing
2. Spring Data JPA for interacting with the database
3. MySQL for storing application data

You can run the application by following these steps:

1.Clone the repository to your local machine
2.Run the command "mvn clean install" to build the application
3.Create a MySQL database and configure the database connection in the application.properties file
4.Run the command "mvn spring-boot:run" to start the application
